# table_processing_plugin
Final project for the Web Technologies subject at FMI, Sofia University

Tasks for the demo:

Importing xlsx files - Tanya
	- Validate styling after Martin
	
Notes: I use contenteditable div's. Some useful resource on updating the table (for the join, filter, etc.): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1391278/contenteditable-change-events\

Manipulating data - Martin\
	- Print only the rows that match the search in the table

Exporting data - Daniel\
	- Add the changes to the README.md file (if havent done so already)

for future
	- maximum of uploaded files\
	- define("SUPPORTED_FILE_EXTENSIONS", ["xlsx"]); from visual.php should be used for importing as well\
	- Add numbers and digits to the cells\
	- Create a dropdown to select an operation (if we add more)\
	- issue: more than 1 sheet in file    ignore???\
	- If the extension of the uploaded file and the wanted extension of the downloaded file aren't the same -> Use library for the conversion \
    	- Use different folder for downloading/conversion stage\
	- Make searching for items in a specific column\
