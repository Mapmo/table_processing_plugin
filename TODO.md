Manipulating data - Martin\
	- Add functionality for uploading multiple tables
	- Create the a dropdown to choose tables  (based on their order in uploading)\
	- Create a dropdown to select an operation (only SELECT for the prototype)\
	- Create a new table called temporary, where you store result of an operation (e.g. SELECT, JOIN)

Exporting data - Daniel\
	+ Create a dropdown to choose the format to save the data (only xlsx atm)\
	+ Create an input field that allows the user to cho0se a name for the new file(s) (should use the data from the names table to suggest the name for the file)\
	- Create a file in the specified format by exporting the data from the DB\
	+ Download it on the client's machine
	- If the extension of the uploaded file and the wanted extension of the downloaded file aren't the same -> Use library for the conversion 
    - Use different folder for downloading/conversion stage
